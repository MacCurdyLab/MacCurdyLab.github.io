  abstract = {Abstract Traditional methods of shielding fragile goods and human tissues from impact energy rely on isotropic foam materials. The mechanical properties of these foams are inferior to an emerging class of metamaterials called plate lattices, which have predominantly been fabricated in simple 2.5-dimensional geometries using conventional methods that constrain the feasible design space. In this work, additive manufacturing is used to relax these constraints and realize plate lattice metamaterials with nontrivial, locally varying geometry. The limitations of traditional computer-aided design tools are circumvented and allow the simulation of complex buckling and collapse behaviors without a manual meshing step. By validating these simulations against experimental data from tests on fabricated samples, sweeping exploration of the plate lattice design space is enabled. Numerical and experimental tests demonstrate plate lattices absorb up to six times more impact energy at equivalent densities relative to foams and shield objects from impacts ten times more energetic while transmitting equivalent peak stresses. In contrast to previous investigations of plate lattice metamaterials, designs with nonuniform geometric prebuckling in the out-of-plane direction is explored and showed that these designs exhibit 10\% higher energy absorption efficiency on average and 25\% higher in the highest-performing design.}

abstract = {Abstract Mechanical properties of traditional engineering materials are typically coupled to each other, presenting a challenge to practitioners with multi-dimensional material property requirements. In this work, continuous, independent control over multiple mechanical properties is demonstrated in composite materials realized using additive manufacturing. For the first time, composites additively manufactured from rigid plastic, soft elastomer, and liquid constituents are experimentally characterized, demonstrating materials which span four orders of magnitude in modulus and two orders of magnitude in toughness. By forming analytical mappings between relative concentrations of constituents at the microscale and resulting macroscale material properties, inverse material design is enabled; the method is showcased by printing artifacts with prescribed toughness and elasticity distributions. The properties of these composites are placed in the context of biological tissues, showing they have promise as mechanically plausible tissue mimics.}

These micro-pumps are high-power resistors that locally vaporize a thin layer of fluid above the resistor surface to form a high-pressure vapor bubble which performs mechanical work. Despite their geometric simplicity, thermal bubble-driven micro-pumps are complex to model due to the multiphysics couplings of Joule heating, thermal bubble nucleation, phase change, and multiphase flow. As such, most simulation approaches simplify the physics by neglecting Joule heating, nucleation, and phase change effects as done in this study. To date, there are no readily available, reduced physics open-source modeling tools that can resolve both pre-collapse (defined as when the bubble is expanding and collapsing) and post-collapse (defined as when the bubble has re-dissolved back into the subcooled fluid) bubble and flow dynamics. In this study, an OpenFOAM framework for modeling thermal bubble-driven micro-pumps is presented, validated, and applied. The developed OpenFOAM model agrees with both experimental data and commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software, FLOW-3D. Additionally, we assess the shape of the transient velocity profile during a pump cycle for the first time and find that it varies substantially from theoretical Poiseuille flow during pre-collapse but is within 25\\% of the theoretical flow profile during post-collapse. We find that this deviation is due to flow never becoming fully developed during each pump cycle. We envision the developed OpenFOAM framework as an open-source CFD toolkit for microfluidic designers to simulate devices with thermal bubble-driven micro-pumps.}",

ABSTRACT = {Thermal bubble-driven micro-pumps are an upcoming actuation technology that can be directly integrated into micro/mesofluidic channels to displace fluid without any moving parts. These pumps consist of high power micro-resistors, which we term thermal micro-pump (TMP) resistors, that locally boil fluid at the resistor surface in microseconds creating a vapor bubble to perform mechanical work. Conventional fabrication approaches of thermal bubble-driven micro-pumps and associated microfluidics have utilized semiconductor micro-fabrication techniques requiring expensive tooling with long turn around times on the order of weeks to months. In this study, we present a low-cost approach to rapidly fabricate and test thermal bubble-driven micro-pumps with associated microfluidics utilizing commercial substrates (indium tin oxide, ITO, and fluorine doped tin oxide, FTO, coated glass) and tooling (laser cutter). The presented fabrication approach greatly reduces the turn around time from weeks/months for conventional micro-fabrication to a matter of hours/days allowing acceleration of thermal bubble-driven micro-pump research and development (R&amp;D) learning cycles.},

abstract = {Multi-material material jetting additive manufacturing processes deposit micro-scale droplets of different model and support materials to build three-dimensional (3D) parts layer by layer. Recent efforts have demonstrated that liquids can act as support materials, which can be easily purged from micro/milli-channels, and as working fluids, which permanently remain in a structure, yet the lack of a detailed understanding of the print process and mechanism has limited widespread applications of liquid printing. In this study, an “all in one go” multi-material print process, herein termed liquid–solid co-printing in which non photo-curable and photo-curable liquid droplets are simultaneous deposited, is extensively characterized. The mechanism of liquid–solid co-printing is explained via experimental high speed imaging and computational fluid dynamic (CFD) studies. This work shows that a liquid’s surface tension can support jetted photopolymer micro-droplets which photo-polymerize on the liquid surface to form a solid layer of material. Design rules for liquid–solid co-printing of micro/milli-fluidic devices are presented as well as case studies of planar, 3D, and multi-material micro/mesofluidic structures such as mixers, droplet generators, highly branching structures, and an integrated one-way flap valve. We envision the liquid–solid co-printing process as a key new capability in additive manufacturing to enable simple and rapid fabrication of 3D, integrated print-in-place multi-material fluidic circuits and hydraulic structures with applications including micro/mesofluidic circuits, electrochemical transistors, lab-on-a-chip devices, and robotics.},

These offer a favorable balance between predictive accuracy and computational cost relative to standard approaches. We find that shell finite elements offer a 7x reduction in analysis time while accurately predicting the behavior of a wide variety of soft actuators. The benefits conferred by shell finite element analysis are especially valuable in contexts where simulation speed is as important as absolute accuracy, such as automated design, optimization, and real-time control.},

abstract = {Soft robots compliment traditional rigid robots by expanding their capabilities to interact with the physical world. A robot made with compliant, soft materials can benefit from their inherent continuum mechanics to achieve interactions with the environment that a rigid robot may find difficult. This can include grasping delicate objects, navigating through variable terrain, or working alongside humans in a safer manner. The flexible, adaptable nature of soft robots provide these benefits, but they also make predicting their actuated response a difficult, computationally-intensive task. Here we provide a non-linear, reduced order model informed by collected data on hydraulically amplified self-healing electrostatic actuators (HASELs). With this reduced order model, we simulate robots comprised of multiple actuators in an effort to rapidly eval- uate potential design candidates without the need for time- consuming manufacturing. The simulation leverages a reduced- order model of HASELs based on a parallel mass spring damper (MSD) representation, made of two non-linear springs, and a damper; this data-driven parameter identification aids model fidelity. We construct a robotic manipulator actuated via six HASELs and show that the simulations driven by the non-linear MSD models accurately predict the robot’s physical behavior on a macro scale. While this work focuses on a specific actuator type, the approach shown here could be extended to other linearly expanding soft actuators. Using this method, soft robotic assemblies actuated via HASELs can be rapidly evaluated in simulation before a laborious manufacturing process, which in turn will allow for faster design iterations to create more effective robots.},

abstract={Soft robotics embraces the design philosophy of function through morphology. Therefore defining the affordances of a soft robotic structure is equivalent to determining the composition and distribution of the materials that make up the robot. This design process has historically been dominated by human intuition and labor-intensive experimentation. However, the design space of multi-material continuum structures is infinite. Automation tools to accelerate soft robot design could enable new designs to be created on-demand, specific to a need, more rapidly and at lower cost than would be possible using human labor alone. In this work we formulate the soft robot design problem as a multi-objective optimization task. We demonstrate a design automation system for bending soft actuators which integrates multi-objective heuristic search with a powerful generative encoding that converts high level design goals, compliance and forcefulness in our case, into mechanical designs automatically. These designs can be directly fabricated using a 3-D printer. We compare numerous simulated results from our optimization and a physical instance fabricated via 3-D printing with a broad survey of contemporary results from the soft robotics literature.},

abstract = {Most applications of 3-dimensional (3D) printing for presurgical planning have been limited to bony structures and simple morphological descriptions of complex organs due to the fundamental limitations in accuracy, quality, and efficiency of the current modeling paradigm. This has largely ignored the soft tissue critical to most surgical specialties where the interior of an object matters and anatomical boundaries transition gradually. Therefore, the needs of the biomedical industry to replicate human tissue, which displays multiple scales of organization and varying material distributions, necessitate new forms of representation. Presented here is a novel technique to create 3D models directly from medical images, which are superior in spatial and contrast resolution to current 3D modeling methods and contain previously unachievable spatial fidelity and soft tissue differentiation. Also presented are empirical measurements of novel, additively manufactured composites that span the gamut of material stiffnesses seen in soft biological tissues from MRI and CT. These unique volumetric design and printing methods allow for deterministic and continuous adjustment of material stiffness and color. This capability enables an entirely new application of additive manufacturing to presurgical planning: mechanical realism. As a natural complement to existing models that provide appearance matching, these new models also allow medical professionals to "feel" the spatially varying material properties of a tissue simulant-a critical addition to a field in which tactile sensation plays a key role.},

Layered assembly is a voxel-based additive manufacturing process that relies on parallel grasping of voxels to produce multi-material parts. Although there exists substantial diversity in mechanisms of gripping, there still exists a lack of consistency, accuracy, and efficacy in positioning very large numbers of milli-, micro-, and nano-scale objects. We demonstrate the use of parallel electro-osmotic grippers to selectively transport multiple millimeter-sized voxels simultaneously. In contrast to previous research focused on using arrays of droplets to grab a single substrate, each element in the array is individually controlled via capillary effects, which are, in turn, controlled by an electric field to create predetermined patterns of droplets to pick and place selected objects. The demonstrated fluidic pick-and-place method has two key advantages: It is suitable for transport of
fragile and complex objects due to the lack of mechanical contact, and it easily parallelizes to arbitrary array sizes for massively parallel pick-and-place. This work demonstrates a 25-element parallel assembly of 1.5-mm spheres with 95–98% grasping reliability, in a variety of geometric patterns. Experimental performance was validated against both analytical and computational models. The results suggest that electro-osmotic droplet arrays may enable the additive manufacturing of multi-material objects containing millions of components in the same print bed.},

A one-dimensional pump model is developed to account for contactless bubble-bubble interactions, and the accuracy of the developed one-dimensional model is assessed via commercial volume of fluid CFD software, FLOW-3D. The FLOW-3D CFD model is validated against experimental bubble dynamics images as well as experimental pump data. Pre-collapse and post-collapse bubble and flow dynamics for two resistors in a channel have been successfully explained by the modified one-dimensional model. The net pumping effect design space is characterized as a function of resistor placement and firing time delay. The one-dimensional model accurately predicts cumulative flow for simultaneous resistor firing with inner-channel resistor placements (0.2L < x < 0.8L where L is the channel length) as well as delayed resistor firing with inner-channel resistor placements when the time delay is greater than the time required for the vapor bubble to fill the channel cross-section. In general, one-dimensional model accuracy suffers at near-reservoir resistor placements and short time delays which we propose is a result of 3D bubble-reservoir interactions and transverse bubble growth interactions respectively that are not captured by the one-dimensional model. We find that the one- dimensional model accuracy improves for smaller channel heights. We envision the developed one-dimensional model as a first-order rapid design tool for inertial pump based microfluidic systems operating in the contactless bubble-bubble interaction non-linear regime.},

One natural application of this technology is the end effector of robotic arms; incorporating deformable actuators into a gripping mechanism allows for the safe integration of robotic assistance in human-occupied settings. While numerous soft robot actuators have been implemented without feedback, force sensing and proprioception are valuable signals to leverage in extending the capabilities of these systems. Prior approaches to integrating sensors into soft robot components have relied on manual processes, or specialized fabrication tools. Our work shows a novel method for automatically manufacturing soft pneumatically-driven actuators with embedded sensors through readily available 3D printing tools with no human fabrication required. Automatically manufacturing these sensor-actuator sys- tems enables more complex, capable, and integrate-able designs, because the labor of assembly is eliminated; actuator-sensor designs that would be tedious or impossible to manufacture become tractable with our approach.},

abstract = {Evolution provides a creative fount of complex and subtle adaptations that often surprise the scientists who discover them. However, the creativity of evolution is not limited to the natural world: artificial organisms evolving in computational environments have also elicited surprise and wonder from the researchers studying them. The process of evolution is an algorithmic process that transcends the substrate in which it occurs. Indeed, many researchers in the field of digital evolution can provide examples of how their evolving algorithms and organisms have creatively subverted their expectations or intentions, exposed unrecognized bugs in their code, produced unexpectedly adaptations, or engaged in behaviors and outcomes uncannily convergent with ones found in nature. Such stories routinely reveal surprise and creativity by evolution in these digital worlds, but they rarely fit into the standard scientific narrative. Instead they are often treated as mere obstacles to be overcome, rather than results that warrant study in their own right. Bugs are fixed, experiments are refocused, and one-off surprises are collapsed into a single data point. The stories themselves are traded among researchers through oral tradition, but that mode of information transmission is inefficient and prone to error and outright loss. Moreover, the fact that these stories tend to be shared only among practitioners means that many natural scientists do not realize how interesting and lifelike digital organisms are and how natural their evolution can be. To our knowledge, no collection of such anecdotes has been published before. This paper is the crowd-sourced product of researchers in the fields of artificial life and evolutionary computation who have provided first-hand accounts of such cases. It thus serves as a written, fact-checked collection of scientifically important and even entertaining stories. In doing so we also present here substantial evidence that the existence and importance of evolutionary surprises extends beyond the natural world, and may indeed be a universal property of all complex evolving systems.},

abstract = {Radio direction-finding techniques have been widely employed by the wildlife track- ing community because they offer powerful, flexible tools for monitoring animal movements and behavior. Reductions in the size and power consumption of GPS chipsets have recently allowed GPS location-finding techniques to also be applied to wildlife monitoring. Despite their successes, these approaches still have signifi- cant shortcomings, primarily due to the energy constraints imposed by the allowable mass of the electrochemical battery that can be carried by the animal. This require- ment causes tag lifetimes to be shorter than desired. Attaching a tracking collar is a risky procedure for all participants, and maximizing the tag service intervals is extremely important. This is true even for large animals, which can carry significant tag mass without behavior disruptions. Therefore, disturbances to the animal (which are primarily driven by tag energy consumption), followed closely by cost are the primary design requirements. These requirements motivate a new tracking system, based on time-of-arrival (TOA) measurements. This system is similar in many respects to GPS; the primary difference is that in this system the mobile asset to be tracked emits, rather than receives, signals. Although transmitting a radiofrequency signal is often the most power-intensive operation for a tag, this choice yields a system with average tag energy requirements that are lower than any current radio-tracking method. Though this chapter focuses on the application of this technology to monitor- ing animal movements, the same set of design criteria apply to generic asset tracking, and we believe that there is a universal need for a local terrestrial tracking system that offers precise positioning with tiny, cheap, long-lived tracking tags.},

Auxetic tilings are scale-independent frameworks made from repeated unit cells that expand under tension. We discovered how to produce handedness in auxetic unit cells that shear as they expand by changing the symmetries and alignments of auxetic tilings. Using the symmetry and alignment rules that we developed, we made handed shearing auxetics that tile planes, cylinders, and spheres.
By compositing the handed shearing auxetics in a manner inspired by keratin and collagen, we produce both compliant structures that expand while twisting and deployable structures that can rigidly lock. This work opens up new possibilities in designing chemical frameworks, medical devices like stents, robotic systems, and deployable engineering structures.},

Cur- rent robotic prototypes do not provide adequate platforms for studying marine life in their natural habitats. This work presents the design, fabrication, control, and oceanic testing of a soft robotic fish that can swim in three di- mensions to continuously record the aquatic life it is following or engaging. Using a miniaturized acoustic com- munication module, a diver can direct the fish by sending commands such as speed, turning angle, and dynamic vertical diving. This work builds on previous generations of robotic fish that were restricted to one plane in shallow water and lacked remote control. Experimental results gathered from tests along coral reefs in the Pacific Ocean show that the robotic fish can successfully navigate around aquatic life at depths ranging from 0 to 18 meters. Furthermore, our robotic fish exhibits a lifelike undulating tail motion enabled by a soft robotic actuator design that can potentially facilitate a more natural integration into the ocean environment. We believe that our study advances beyond what is currently achievable using traditional thruster-based and tethered autonomous under- water vehicles, demonstrating methods that can be used in the future for studying the interactions of aquatic life and ocean dynamics.},

abstract = {The ability to takeoff quickly and accelerate away from predators is crucial to bird survival. Crude oil can disrupt the fine structure and function of feathers, and here we tested for the first time how small amounts of oil on the trailing edges of the wings and tail of Western sandpipers (Calidris mauri) affected takeoff flight performance. In oiled birds, the distance travelled during the first 0.4 s after takeoff was reduced by 29%, and takeoff angle was decreased by 10° compared to unoiled birds. Three-axis accelerometry indicated that oiled sandpipers produced less mechanical power output per wingbeat during the initial phase of flight. Slower and lower takeoff would make oiled birds more likely to be targeted and captured by predators, reducing survival and facilitating the exposure of predators to oil. Whereas the direct mortality of heavily-oiled birds is often obvious and can be quantified, our results show that there are significant sub-lethal effects of small amounts crude oil on feathers, which must be considered in natural resource injury assessments for birds.},

abstract = {Negative density-dependence is generally studied within a single trophic level, thereby neglecting its effect on higher trophic levels. The ‘functional response’ couples a predator’s intake rate to prey density. Most widespread is a type II functional response, where intake rate increases asymptotically with prey den- sity; this predicts the highest predator densities at the highest prey densities. In one of the most stringent tests of this generality to date, we measured density and quality of bivalve prey (edible cockles Cerastoderma edule) across 50 km2 of mudflat, and simultaneously, with a novel time-of-arrival methodology, tracked their avian predators (red knots Calidris canutus). Because of negative density-dependence in the individual quality of cockles, the predicted energy intake rates of red knots declined at high prey densities (a type IV, rather than a type II functional response). Resource-selection modelling revealed that red knots indeed selected areas of intermediate cockle densities where energy intake rates were maximized given their phenotype-specific digestive constraints (as indicated by gizzard mass). Because negative density- dependence is common, we question the current consensus and suggest that predators commonly maximize their energy intake rates at intermediate prey densities. Prey density alone may thus poorly predict intake rates, carrying capacity and spatial distributions of predators.},

abstract = {The confluence of advancements in microelectronic components and vibrational energy harvesting has opened the possibility of remote sensor units powered solely from the motion of their hosts. There are numerous applications of such systems, including the development of modern wildlife tracking/data-logging devices. These ‘bio-logging’ devices are typically mass- constrained because they must be carried by an animal. Thus, they have historically traded scientific capability for operational longevity due to restrictions on battery size. Recently, the precipitous decrease in the power requirements of microelectronics has been accompanied by advancements in the area of piezoelectric vibrational energy harvesting. These energy harvesting devices are now capable of powering the type of microelectronic circuits used in bio-logging devices. In this paper we consider the feasibility of employing these vibrational energy harvesters on flying vertebrates for the purpose of powering a bio-logging device. We show that the excess energy available from birds and bats could be harvested without adversely affecting their overall energy budget. We then present acceleration measurements taken on flying birds in a flight tunnel to understand modulation of flapping frequency during steady flight. Finally, we use a recently developed method of estimating the maximum power output from a piezoelectric energy harvester to determine the amount of power that could be practically harvested from a flying bird. The results of this analysis show that the average power output of a piezoelectric energy harvester mounted to a bird or bat could produce more than enough power to run a bio- logging device. We compare the power harvesting capabilities to the energy requirements of an example system and conclude that vibrational energy harvesting on flying birds and bats is viable and warrants further study, including testing.},

abstract = {Discrete animal-mounted sensors and tags have a wide range of potential applications for researching wild animals and their environments. The devices could be used to monitor location, metabolic output, or used as environmental monitoring sentinels. These applications are made possible by recent decreases in the size, mass, and power consumption of modern microelectronics. Despite these performance increases, for extended deployments these systems need to generate power in-situ. In this work, we explore a device that was recently deployed to test the concept of piezoelectric energy harvesting on flying birds. We explain the development of the device and introduce test results conducted on flying pigeons (Columba livia). The testing device consisted of a miniature data acquisition system, piezoelectric energy har- vester, and actuator system. The output of the energy harvester was monitored by a microcontroller and recorded throughout the flight. The energy harvester included a wireless receiver, bat- tery and linear servo. By remotely actuating the linear servo, we were able to arrest the energy harvester for portions of the flight. In doing so, we will be able to compare flight accelerations of a bird with a simple proof mass and with a dynamic mass without having to stop the flight of the bird. The comparison of these two cases allows for the assessment of the feasibility of employing vibrational energy harvesting on a flying bird. We present the initial results of this testing with regard to the harvested power and the in-flight acceleration profiles.},

booktitle = {Proceedings of the15th annual conference on genetic and evolutionary computation (GECCO)},
year = {2013},
abstract = {In 1994 Karl Sims showed that computational evolution can produce interesting morphologies that resemble natural or- ganisms. Despite nearly two decades of work since, evolved morphologies are not obviously more complex or natural, and the field seems to have hit a complexity ceiling. One hypothesis for the lack of increased complexity is that most work, including Sims’, evolves morphologies composed of rigid elements, such as solid cubes and cylinders, limiting the design space. A second hypothesis is that the encod- ings of previous work have been overly regular, not allow- ing complex regularities with variation. Here we test both hypotheses by evolving soft robots with multiple materials and a powerful generative encoding called a compositional pattern-producing network (CPPN). Robots are selected for locomotion speed. We find that CPPNs evolve faster robots than a direct encoding and that the CPPN morphologies appear more natural. We also find that locomotion per- formance increases as more materials are added, that di- versity of form and behavior can be increased with differ- ent cost functions without stifling performance, and that organisms can be evolved at different levels of resolution. These findings suggest the ability of generative soft-voxel systems to scale towards evolving a large diversity of com- plex, natural, multi-material creatures. Our results suggest that future work that combines the evolution of CPPN- encoded soft, multi-material robots with modern diversity- encouraging techniques could finally enable the creation of creatures far more complex and interesting than those pro- duced by Sims nearly twenty years ago.},

abstract = {Light-level geolocation data loggers, or geologgers, have recently been miniaturized to the extent that they can be deployed on small songbirds, allowing us to determine many previously unknown migration routes, breeding locations, and wintering sites. Use of geologgers on small birds has great potential to help address major research and conservation questions, but the method is not without its shortcomings. Among these shortcomings are the need to recapture birds after they have carried a device throughout a migration cycle and the potential for the devices to affect survival and behavior. We examined return rates of birds with geologgers in published and unpublished studies and found no evidence of a general negative effect of geologgers on survival, although there were a few individual studies where such an effect was evident. From these same studies, we found that most currently used harness materials are equivalent in terms of failure rates, and the most reliable geologgers are those made by the British Antarctic Survey (although these were also the largest geologgers used in the studies we examined). With regard to analysis methods, we believe there is much room for improvement. Use of online archiving of both data and analysis parameters would greatly improve the repeatability and transparency of geologger research.},

For many reasons, it would be beneficial to have the capability of powering a wildlife tag over the course of multiple migratory seasons. Such an energy harvesting system would allow for more data collection and eliminate the need to replace depleted batteries. In this work, we investigate energy harvesting on birds and focus on vibrational energy harvesting. We review a method of predicting the amount of power that can be safely harvested from the birds such that the effect on their longterm survivability is not compromised. After showing that the safely harvestable power is significant in comparison to the circuits used in avian tags, we present testing results for the flight accelerations of two species of birds. Using these measured values, we then design harvesters that matched the flight acceleration frequency and are sufficiently low mass to be carried by the birds.},

abstract = {Evolving controllers for multilegged robots in simulation is convenient and flexible, making it possible to prototype ideas rapidly. However, transferring the resulting controllers to physical robots is challenging because it is difficult to simulate real-world complexities with sufficient accuracy. This paper bridges this gap by utilizing the Evolution of Network Symmetry and mOdularity (ENSO) approach to evolve modular neural network controllers that are robust to discrepancies between simulation and reality. This approach was evaluated by building a physical quadruped robot and by evolving controllers for it in simulation. An approximate model of the robot and its environment was built in a physical simulation and uncertainties in the real world were modeled as noise. The resulting controllers produced well-synchronized trot gaits when they were transferred to the physical robot, even on different walking surfaces. In contrast to a hand-designed PID controller, the evolved controllers also generalized well to changes in experimental conditions such as loss of voltage and were more robust against faults such as loss of a leg, making them strong candidates for real-world applications.},

volume = {156},
abstract = {A novel imaging and software platform was developed for the high-throughput phenotyping of three-dimensional root traits during seedling development. To demonstrate the platform’s capacity, plants of two rice (Oryza sativa) genotypes, Azucena and IR64, were grown in a transparent gellan gum system and imaged daily for 10 d. Rotational image sequences consisting of 40 two-dimensional images were captured using an optically corrected digital imaging system. Three-dimensional root reconstructions were generated and analyzed using a custom-designed software, RootReader3D. Using the automated and interactive capabilities of RootReader3D, five rice root types were classified and 27 phenotypic root traits were measured to characterize these two genotypes. Where possible, measurements from the three-dimensional platform were validated and were highly correlated with conventional two-dimensional measurements. When comparing gellan gum-grown plants with those grown under hydroponic and sand culture, significant differences were detected in morphological root traits (P < 0.05). This highly flexible platform provides the capacity to measure root traits with a high degree of spatial and temporal resolution and will facilitate novel investigations into the development of entire root systems or selected components of root systems. In combination with the extensive genetic resources that are now available, this platform will be a powerful resource to further explore the molecular and genetic determinants of root system architecture.},

By attaching a low-power management circuit (weighing 0.200 grams) to the energy harvester and accumulating the converted energy onboard the flying insect, we are able to visually demonstrate pulsed power delivery (averaging 196 mW) by intermittently flashing a light emitting diode. This self-recharging system offers biologists a new means for powering onboard electronics used to study small flying animals. Using this approach, the lifetime of the electronics would be limited only by the lifetime of the individuals, a vast improvement over current methods.},

abstract = {Wildlife monitoring tags are a widely used technique for studying animals in their natural habitats. At present, these devices are energy limited, based on the mass of the electrochemical battery that can be carried by the animal. Flying animals are particularly restricted, based on a requirement for minimal excess loading. This requirement causes tag lifetimes to be far shorter than would be useful from an ecological perspective, particularly for smaller animals. Energy harvesting is being widely adopted in applications where access to permanent power is limited. If applied to wildlife tags, this approach offers the possibility of extending functional lifetimes indefinitely; however, it presents unique challenges. Practical applications on flying animals are extremely mass limited, subject to environmental stress, and operate at very low frequencies. This paper is meant to address the critical issues in the design task, and makes attempts to place bounds on unknown design parameters, based on literature research where applicable, and on experiment when no data exists. We discuss candidate harvester materials, novel data acquisition tools, and a prototype harvester design.},
