  abstract = {Abstract Traditional methods of shielding fragile goods and human tissues from impact energy rely on isotropic foam materials. The mechanical properties of these foams are inferior to an emerging class of metamaterials called plate lattices, which have predominantly been fabricated in simple 2.5-dimensional geometries using conventional methods that constrain the feasible design space. In this work, additive manufacturing is used to relax these constraints and realize plate lattice metamaterials with nontrivial, locally varying geometry. The limitations of traditional computer-aided design tools are circumvented and allow the simulation of complex buckling and collapse behaviors without a manual meshing step. By validating these simulations against experimental data from tests on fabricated samples, sweeping exploration of the plate lattice design space is enabled. Numerical and experimental tests demonstrate plate lattices absorb up to six times more impact energy at equivalent densities relative to foams and shield objects from impacts ten times more energetic while transmitting equivalent peak stresses. In contrast to previous investigations of plate lattice metamaterials, designs with nonuniform geometric prebuckling in the out-of-plane direction is explored and showed that these designs exhibit 10\% higher energy absorption efficiency on average and 25\% higher in the highest-performing design.}

abstract = {Abstract Mechanical properties of traditional engineering materials are typically coupled to each other, presenting a challenge to practitioners with multi-dimensional material property requirements. In this work, continuous, independent control over multiple mechanical properties is demonstrated in composite materials realized using additive manufacturing. For the first time, composites additively manufactured from rigid plastic, soft elastomer, and liquid constituents are experimentally characterized, demonstrating materials which span four orders of magnitude in modulus and two orders of magnitude in toughness. By forming analytical mappings between relative concentrations of constituents at the microscale and resulting macroscale material properties, inverse material design is enabled; the method is showcased by printing artifacts with prescribed toughness and elasticity distributions. The properties of these composites are placed in the context of biological tissues, showing they have promise as mechanically plausible tissue mimics.}

abstract = "{Thermal bubble-driven micro-pumps (also known as inertial pumps) are an upcoming micro-pump technology that can be integrated directly into micro/mesofluidic channels to displace fluid without moving parts. These micro-pumps are high-power resistors that locally vaporize a thin layer of fluid above the resistor surface to form a high-pressure vapor bubble which performs mechanical work. Despite their geometric simplicity, thermal bubble-driven micro-pumps are complex to model due to the multiphysics couplings of Joule heating, thermal bubble nucleation, phase change, and multiphase flow. As such, most simulation approaches simplify the physics by neglecting Joule heating, nucleation, and phase change effects as done in this study. To date, there are no readily available, reduced physics open-source modeling tools that can resolve both pre-collapse (defined as when the bubble is expanding and collapsing) and post-collapse (defined as when the bubble has re-dissolved back into the subcooled fluid) bubble and flow dynamics. In this study, an OpenFOAM framework for modeling thermal bubble-driven micro-pumps is presented, validated, and applied. The developed OpenFOAM model agrees with both experimental data and commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software, FLOW-3D. Additionally, we assess the shape of the transient velocity profile during a pump cycle for the first time and find that it varies substantially from theoretical Poiseuille flow during pre-collapse but is within 25\\% of the theoretical flow profile during post-collapse. We find that this deviation is due to flow never becoming fully developed during each pump cycle. We envision the developed OpenFOAM framework as an open-source CFD toolkit for microfluidic designers to simulate devices with thermal bubble-driven micro-pumps.}",

ABSTRACT = {Thermal bubble-driven micro-pumps are an upcoming actuation technology that can be directly integrated into micro/mesofluidic channels to displace fluid without any moving parts. These pumps consist of high power micro-resistors, which we term thermal micro-pump (TMP) resistors, that locally boil fluid at the resistor surface in microseconds creating a vapor bubble to perform mechanical work. Conventional fabrication approaches of thermal bubble-driven micro-pumps and associated microfluidics have utilized semiconductor micro-fabrication techniques requiring expensive tooling with long turn around times on the order of weeks to months. In this study, we present a low-cost approach to rapidly fabricate and test thermal bubble-driven micro-pumps with associated microfluidics utilizing commercial substrates (indium tin oxide, ITO, and fluorine doped tin oxide, FTO, coated glass) and tooling (laser cutter). The presented fabrication approach greatly reduces the turn around time from weeks/months for conventional micro-fabrication to a matter of hours/days allowing acceleration of thermal bubble-driven micro-pump research and development (R&amp;D) learning cycles.},
