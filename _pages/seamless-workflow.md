<a href = "assets/pdf/2021_Smith_Seamless_Acuator_Synthesis_CASE_2021.pdf">A Seamless Workflow for Design and Fabrication of Multimaterial Pneumatic Soft Actuators. Accepted to IEEE CASE 2021</a>

This research earned the <a href = "https://case2021.sciencesconf.org/resource/page/id/37">IEEE-CASE Best Application Paper Award</a> at the 2021 CASE Conference in Lyon, France!

### Highlights
â€‹
- A novel software workflow for exploration of the complex design space of pneumatic soft actuators
- Prioritization of seamless connectivity between design and evaluation phases: geometry and material specification, visualization, simulation, and fabrication 
- A graphical user interface for interactive exploration of computational network representations of implicit geometry functions
- Automated generation of simulation input files for one-click execution of nonlinear FEA evaluation of candidate designs

### A Seamless Workflow

- Multimaterial soft actuators at progressive stages of development in our workflow. From left: signed distance function geometry description; surface triangulation and material assignment; simulated deformation during actuation; preparation for additive manufacturing; 3D-printed actuator.
