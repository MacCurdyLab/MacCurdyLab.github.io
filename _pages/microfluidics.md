Our microfluidic research is focused on (a) low-cost fabrication techniques and (b) low-cost micro-pump technologies. We utilize a mix of 3D printing and adhesive transfer tape microfluidics to create customizable microfluidic devices that are low-cost and easy to replicate. To move fluid at the micro-scale, we utilize inertial pumps which are based upon thermal inkjet technology. A high power resistor is used to create a rapidly expanding and collapsing vapor bubble which moves fluid in micro-channels. Our research seeks to understand and apply inertial pumps to lab-on-a-chip technologies.
