<div style="display: flex;">
    <div style="flex: 2;padding-right: 30px;">
We develop software workflows and advanced multimaterial 3D printing capabilities for fabricating patient-specific presurgical models with our partners at CU Anschutz. These models help surgeons plan surgical procedures and visualize complex 3D tissue structures.
