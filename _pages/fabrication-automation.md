We build functional objects from multiple materials using state of the art additive manufacturing processes. The vision is that robots and other electromechanical systems are ready to use when you remove them from the printer. To do this, we are developing algorithms to verify that a particular multimaterial design will actually be printable, even if it includes some materials that are stiff as epoxy and others that flow like water. We develop our own multimaterial 3D printers, and we also use two commercial inkjet printers, capable of depositing up to 8 different material types in a 3D object.


## Projects

   <div style="width: 60%;">
      1. 3D Printed Microfluidics**
   We explore 3D printing of microfluidics to enable customizability, multi-material, and rapid prototyping. The ability to 3D print microfluidics allows realization of fully 3D channel geometries and structures previously infeasible through conventional 2.5D soft lithography approaches.
   
   Liquid-Solid Co-Printing (printing with liquids and solids)**
   Liquid-solid co-printing of multi-material 3D fluidic devices via material jetting.
